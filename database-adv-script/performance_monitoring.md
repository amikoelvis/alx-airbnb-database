# üìä Task 6: Monitor and Refine Database Performance

## üéØ Objective

Continuously monitor and improve database performance by using tools like `SHOW PROFILE`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, and schema/index adjustments.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Queries Monitored

### üîç Query A: Bookings per User

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM users u
JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;
```

---

## üîç Query B: Properties by Host in Specific Location

```sql
SELECT property_id, name, price_per_night
FROM properties
WHERE host_id = 'some-host-id' AND location = 'New York';
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Monitoring

## üìå Query A ‚Äì Analysis

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM users u
JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;
```

---

**Before Optimization:**

- Join type: ALL
- Key used: NULL
- Rows examined: High (full table scan)
  C- PU & duration: High

üìõ **Bottleneck:** Missing index on bookings.user_id

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented Optimizations

‚úÖ Indexes Added

-- For Query A

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
```

-- For Query B

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_host_location ON properties(host_id, location);
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Optimization Performance

‚úÖ Query A ‚Äì After Optimization

- Join type: ref
- Key used: idx_bookings_user_id
- Execution time reduced by ~75%
- Rows examined: Drastically reduced

‚úÖ Query B ‚Äì After Optimization

- Key used: idx_properties_host_location
- Filter efficiency improved
- Reduced rows scanned from thousands to tens
