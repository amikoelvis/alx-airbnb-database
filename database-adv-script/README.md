# üß© SQL Join Practice ‚Äì Complex Queries

## üéØ Objective

Master SQL joins by writing **complex queries** using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to retrieve and combine data across multiple related tables.

This exercise uses a normalized schema similar to an Airbnb-like system, including `users`, `properties`, `bookings`, and `reviews`.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. INNER JOIN ‚Äì Bookings and Users

**Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.**

```sql
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.password_hash,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at AS user_created_at
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id;
```

---

üîé **Explanation:** Returns only bookings that have a matching user. Unmatched data from either table is excluded.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. LEFT JOIN ‚Äì Properties and Reviews

**Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.**

```sql
SELECT
    p.property_id,
    p.host_id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    p.created_at,
    p.updated_at,
    r.review_id,
    r.property_id AS review_property_id,
    r.user_id AS reviewer_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment,
    r.created_at AS review_created_at
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;
```

---

üîé Explanation: Returns all properties, along with any matching reviews. If a property has no reviews, the review fields will be NULL.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. FULL OUTER JOIN (Emulated) ‚Äì Users and Bookings

**Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.**

```sql
-- Emulating FULL OUTER JOIN using UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.password_hash,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at AS user_created_at,
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id AS booking_user_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at AS booking_created_at
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id

UNION

SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.password_hash,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at AS user_created_at,
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id AS booking_user_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at AS booking_created_at
FROM users u
RIGHT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

---

**Explanation:** Combines the results of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN to simulate a FULL OUTER JOIN. Ensures:

Users without bookings are included.

Bookings not linked to valid users are also included.

---

# üîÑ SQL Subqueries Practice

## üéØ Objective

Practice writing both **correlated** and **non-correlated** subqueries using a normalized Airbnb-style database schema. The goal is to filter data using nested queries while ensuring all relevant fields are retrieved.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Non-Correlated Subquery ‚Äì Properties with High Average Ratings

**Task**: Find all properties where the **average review rating** is greater than `4.0`.

```sql
SELECT
    p.property_id,
    p.host_id,
    p.name,
    p.description,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    p.created_at,
    p.updated_at
FROM properties p
WHERE p.property_id IN (
    SELECT r.property_id
    FROM reviews r
    GROUP BY r.property_id
    HAVING AVG(r.rating) > 4.0
);
```

---

üìå **Explanation:**

The subquery calculates the average rating for each property.

The outer query retrieves all property details for those meeting the rating threshold.

This is a non-correlated subquery ‚Äî it runs independently of the outer query.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Correlated Subquery ‚Äì Users with More Than 3 Bookings

**Task**: Task: Find all users who have made more than three bookings..

```sql
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.password_hash,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at
FROM users u
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM bookings b
    WHERE b.user_id = u.user_id
) > 3;

```

---

üìå **Explanation:**

The subquery counts bookings per user by referencing the outer query‚Äôs u.user_id.

Users with more than 3 bookings are returned.

This is a correlated subquery ‚Äî it runs once per row in the outer query.

---

# üìä SQL Aggregations & Window Functions Practice

## üéØ Objective

Apply SQL **aggregation functions** and **window functions** to analyze data from a normalized Airbnb-style database schema.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Aggregation: Total Bookings per User

**Task**: Use `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY` to find the total number of bookings made by each user.

```sql
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.password_hash,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.password_hash,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at;
```

---

üìå **Explanation:**

COUNT(b.booking_id) counts how many bookings each user has made.

LEFT JOIN ensures users with zero bookings are included.

All fields from the users table are selected for completeness and potential auditing.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Window Function: Rank Properties by Total Bookings

**Task**: Use a window function to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they‚Äôve received..

```sql
SELECT
    ranked.property_id,
    ranked.host_id,
    ranked.name,
    ranked.description,
    ranked.location,
    ranked.price_per_night,
    ranked.created_at,
    ranked.updated_at,
    ranked.total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ranked.total_bookings DESC) AS row_number,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ranked.total_bookings DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        p.property_id,
        p.host_id,
        p.name,
        p.description,
        p.location,
        p.price_per_night,
        p.created_at,
        p.updated_at,
        COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
    FROM properties p
    LEFT JOIN bookings b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
    GROUP BY
        p.property_id,
        p.host_id,
        p.name,
        p.description,
        p.location,
        p.price_per_night,
        p.created_at,
        p.updated_at
) AS ranked;
```

---

üîç **Explanation:**
ROW_NUMBER() gives a strict sequence (1, 2, 3‚Ä¶) ‚Äî even when booking counts are tied.

RANK() gives equal ranking for ties (e.g., 1, 1, 3‚Ä¶).

Both rankings help you analyze and compare property performance more flexibly.
